Given a binary tree, populate nextRight pointers in each node and return the root of the tree.



* Constraint: Use only constant extra space.



e.g. Given this:

         a
       /  \
      b    c
     / \    \
    d   e    f


Turn it into this:

         a -> nil
       /  \
      b -> c -> nil
     / \    \
    d -> e -> f -> nil


Note that 'c' doesn't have both children. It only has right child. So we need to connect 'e' to 'f'.



Solution: This is one of the best solutions out there. Has a two-line explanation though. If you need more clarity, please ask the TA. 





Notes:

Suggested time in interview: 40 minutes.

The “Suggested Time” is the time expected to complete this question during a real-life interview, not now in homework i.e. For the first attempt of a given homework problem, the focus should be to understand what the problem is asking, what approach you are using, coding it, as well as identifying any gaps that you can discuss during a TA session. Take your time, but limit yourself to 2 one hour sessions for most problems.
