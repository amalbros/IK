Given a binary tree, print out all of its root-to-leaf paths one per line.

e.g. for a tree that's 

   1

 2  3

4 5 6 7

Print:

1 2 4

1 2 5

1 3 6

1 3 7

(This is a simple problem, but really tests your understanding of recursion)

Notes:

If your output and expected output looks similar, but still you are getting wrong answer, then check trailing spaces. In order to pass, your output must match expected output exactly.

Suggested time in interview: 20 minutes

The “Suggested Time” is the time expected to complete this question during a real-life interview, not now in homework i.e. For the first attempt of a given homework problem, the focus should be to understand what the problem is asking, what approach you are using, coding it, as well as identifying any gaps that you can discuss during a TA session. Take your time, but limit yourself to 2 one hour sessions for most problems.
