Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.



1. Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.

2. Calling hasNext() should return whether the next element exists.



Both functions should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.



[Iterator is a concept in higher level languages like C++ or Java. You probably can tell what it is. If you want to know more, please feel free to Google for the concept.]



Solutions: 

1. With parent pointer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12850889/in-order-iterator-for-binary-tree

2. Without parent pointer, but with stack: https://leetcode.com/discuss/20001/my-solutions-in-3-languages-with-stack



Choice of the solution will depend on what the interviewer asks you to do. #2 is generally preferred i.e. without assuming there is a parent pointer.







Notes:

Suggested time in interview: 30 minutes

The “Suggested Time” is the time expected to complete this question during a real-life interview, not now in homework i.e. For the first attempt of a given homework problem, the focus should be to understand what the problem is asking, what approach you are using, coding it, as well as identifying any gaps that you can discuss during a TA session. Take your time, but limit yourself to 2 one hour sessions for most problems.
