Given a point P, and other N points in two dimensional space, find K points out of the N points which are nearest to P.



* Distance between two points is measured by standard euclidean method.



(Hint: This problem can either be done with QuickSort partitioning, or can be done with Heaps. Which one would you use? Why? Why not try both in your IDE and see the runtime for large inputs?)
