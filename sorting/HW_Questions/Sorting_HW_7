Please convert the standard merge-sort algorithm into code.



Input: Integers in an array, duplicates possible

Output: Same integers in ascending order, in a new array. Preserve the input array.



(Goal of this homework problem: The concept of partitioning, concept of merging partitions, the clarity that merge-sort needs extra space and why worst-case is better than QuickSort viz. O(NLogN))
