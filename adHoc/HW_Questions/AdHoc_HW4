Area under histogram





Problem Statement:



Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram, where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of

contiguous bars. For simplicity, assume that all bars have same width and the width is 1 unit.



For example, consider the following histogram with 7 bars of heights {6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6}. The largest possible

rectangle possible is 12 (see the below figure, the max area rectangle is highlighted in red).





â€‹

You will be given an array arr of height of bars of size n. You have to answer q queries, where in each query, you will be 

given left and right. For each query, return largest rectangular area possible in a histogram formed using

(right-left+1) bars with array of heights as arr[left], arr[left+1], arr[left+2],...,arr[right].



Input Format:



There are three arguments: arr, denoting input array of height of bars, l denoting left and r denoting right as explained

in problem statement



Output Format:



Return a number maxArea, denoting maximum area possible in a histogram formed as explained in problem statement



Constraints:



1 <= n <= 10^6

1 <= q <= 100

1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, i=0,1,2,3,...,n-1



Sample Test Cases:



Sample Input 1:



arr = [6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6]

q = 1

For 1st query: l = 0 and r = 6.



Sample Output 1:



12



Explanation 1:



* 1st query: A rectangle of area 12 can be formed using 2nd to 4th bar (0 base indexing) and has maximum area possible in

histogram out of all possible rectangles that can be formed using contiguous bar.



Sample Input 2:



arr = [2, 4, 6, 5, 8]

q = 2

For 1st query: l = 0 and r = 4.

For 2nd query: l = 3 and r = 3.



Sample Output 2:



16

5



Explanation 2:



* 1st query: A rectangle of area 16 can be formed using 1st to 4th bar (0 base indexing) and has maximum area possible in

histogram out of all possible rectangles that can be formed using contiguous bar.

* 2nd query: A rectangle of area 5 can be formed using 3rd to 3rd bar (0 base indexing).
