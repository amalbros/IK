A number is represented by a linked list, with the head of the linked list being the least significant digit.

For example 12 is represented as 2->1, and 23 is represented as 3->2

Adding 2->1 and 3->2 should produce 5->3 which is equivalent to (35).

Write a function which adds two linked lists returning the sum in form of a new linked list. 
Ignoring the allocation of a new linked list, try to use constant memory when solving it.
